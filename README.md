JOURNAL RESPONSES

Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

The client is DriverPass and in the interview transcript, DriverPass is represented by the owner Liam and the IT specialist Ian. The purpose of this project is to design an online system for DriverPass’s driver education program. According to the transcript Liam would like a system that provides online classes and practice testing, with the added option of scheduling on-the road training. This system is meant to help the vast number of drivers who fail their driving test, up to 65% fail. DriverPass would like the system to be accessible remotely, allowing the ability to download reports and spreadsheets. The system that DriverPass is looking for must fill the void currently present in the driver education program. According to the transcript Liam states that, “I noticed that there is a need for better driver training. So many people fail their driving tests at the DMV”. After completion, the system should be fully online, remotely accessible, secure and linked to the DMV database. Customers should be able to access the system and schedule appointments as they need to. DMV compliance and updates should be automatically set to the always keep the system compliant with DMV regulations.



What did you do particularly well?

I was able to determine the client’s requirements accurately. According to instructor feedback, “Overall, you did a very good job with addressing assignment prompts.”



If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

The part I would revise would be the business requirements document from Project 1. A clearer explanation would have helped my bulletin points have more weight. As per instructor feedback, “there was no mention of driver packages in a general manner or access control of users as part of the system background” (Stefanelli, 2022). 



How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

The user needs were implemented during the design phase when the user requirements were collected. Implementing the user’s needs early in the design phase assures that we are meeting the client’s requirements.



How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

The SDLC gives a foundation on how the design process is conducted. Client’s needs are assessed and analyzed at the beginning of the design process through JAD in most cases or interviews. After the clients needs are determined, the next step would be to build the system requirements based on theses client’s needs, advising what can and cannot be achieved from the client’s needs.
